						GIT INFORMATION
1. Three levels  
	git config --system (Top most) 	/etc/gitconfig
	git config --global (User) 	~/.gitconfig
	git config --local  (Folder)	.git/config

	local overrides global and global overrides system
	default setting is global, means do not need to give --global

2. Staging means .git/index file will have the changes

3. Committing without m flag will open editor and ask you to add the commit message.

4. git log gives output in reverse chronological order

5. Remote and master branch commits will come prior to other branch commits while merging

6. Fast forward when master has no additional commits since it was branched and branch has many commits and branch is merged in local repository

7. Recursive when master has additional commits since it was branched and branch has many commits and branch is merged in local repository,
   Master commits will get priority in sequence and then branch commits then a new merge commit in both either conflict is there or not.

8. If same file has been changed on local as well as on remote then pushing before pulling is rejected, after pulling a new merge commit is created.

9. Remote repository is termed as origin and local repository is termed as master

10. Before pushing to remote always stash your changes and get pull --rebase and retrieve from stash

11. git branch shows active branch with * sign

12. always analyze the difference before merging

13. Never use git rebase on public branch
