Committing added files with comment
	git commit -m "Git start with initial commands"

Pusing committed files to remote, it will ask credentials
	git push

For checking any change in repository
	git status

Before push local files should be in sync with remote branch, 
First we should save our changes in stash
	git stash

For sync with remote branch
	git pull --rebase

For getting the previous saved code from stash
	git stash pop

Then same process, we can also add and commit with single command
	git commit -am "Added more commands"

If you clone remote branch by git ssh url 
	git clone git@github.com:ashishjaintech/docker.git
It will give you error : The authenticity of host 'github.com (13.234.210.38)' can't be established.
	Github requires public key for ssh verification. 
Steps for solving this problem :-
	1. Generate public key
		ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "ASHISHJAINTECH@GMAIL.COM"
	This command will generate pub key at following path
	Windows : c/Users/dell/.ssh/
	Ubuntu : go to user home directory 
		/home/asjain
		press ctrl + h for showing hidden .ssh folder
		then you can copy content from file /home/asjain 
		or get the content from cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
	2. Open this file : id_rsa.pub
	3. Go to github account in Personal settings
	4. Click on SSH and GPG keys option
	5. Add New 
	6. Give the title name 
	7. Copy content from id_rsa.pub and paste it in key option
	8. Press Add ssh key button
	9. It will ask password to continue
	10 You have successfully added ssh key, now you can clone repositories with ssh url


Steps creating a project locally and push to remote repository
	1. Create a remote repository on git hub jenkin
	2. Create a new repository/folder on the command line jenkin
	3. cd in jenkin folder 
	4. echo "# projects" >> README.md
	5. git init
	6. git add README.md
	7. git commit -m "first commit"
	8. git remote add origin https://github.com/ashishjaintech/jenkin
	9. git push -u origin master



Adding your profile in office system.
	
You can configure an individual repo to use a specific user / email address which overrides the global configuration. 
Go to the root of the repository
	git config user.name "ASHISH JAIN"
	git config user.email "ASHISHJAINTECH@GMAIL.COM"


And for remaining system global configuration will work as created on the top, because global user / email is configured in your ~/.gitconfig


How to connect private repository from different system.
Steps 
	1. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "ASHISHJAINTECH@GMAIL.COM"
	2. copy the content from id_rsa.pub
	3. add it in the settings in gitup by adding new key in ssh and gpg keys section
	4. git clone git@github.com:ashishjaintech/projects.git


Pushing to your personal repository from office system
	set git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ashishjaintech/git.git otherwise it will take default, office id.
